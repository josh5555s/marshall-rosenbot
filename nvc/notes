DB MODELS

poems and strategies should have connections to both satisfied needs and frusterated needs (unselected needs are therefore neutral)

Create a Stratagy model which instanciates stratagies to get needs met (reference spreadsheet made awhile back).
The stratagies include the needs they support and the needs they hinder.
Stratagies can also be linked to in the poetry model, but blank=True
